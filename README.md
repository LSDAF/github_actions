# GitHub Actions for LSDAF

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows for managing Docker images for the LSDAF organization.

## Workflows

### üê≥ Build and Push Docker Image by SHA

#### Access Control

The workflow implements strict access control:
- Only organization admins can push images
- Organization maintainers and regular members are blocked with specific error messages
- The workflow verifies that the specified Git commit SHA exists
- The workflow checks that the Dockerfile exists before attempting to build

   - **Additional tags** (optional): Semicolon-separated list of additional tags to apply to the image (e.g., "v1.0;stable;production"). If empty, only the Git SHA will be used as a tag.

#### Error Handling

The workflow will fail with specific error messages in the following cases:
- If the user is not an organization admin
- If the specified Git commit SHA doesn't exist
- If the Dockerfile doesn't exist at the expected location (docker/Dockerfile)
